- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned



```css
@keyframes remove-animation {
    0%{right: 0.5rem; top: -5rem; opacity: 1;}    
    100%{right: 0.5rem; top: -3.5rem; opacity: 0;}
}
```

### Continued development
I have definetly enjoyed working with css animation, it is an area I would like to explore more and create seamless animations. I am still a newbie when it comes to javascript so i will continue to take on more intermidiete projects to level up my skills.
